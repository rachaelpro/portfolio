                  <p>"Rachael is an energetic, smart, and conscientious worker. During her internship at Tanium, she quickly learned complex subject matter and became proficient at new tools. Technical obstacles never fazed Rachael; she had the patience to overcome them herself or work through them with others. She always stayed focused on her objectives, methodically planned how to achieve them, and worked diligently to complete them. Rachael had to work with many people of different roles on multiple assignments and easily adjusted to all the different team dynamics and expectations. It has been a privilege to work with her."</p>
